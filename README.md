A ML model that aims to find unique companions for a given plant

## The Idea
Companion planting is a gardening technique in which certain plants are grown in close proximity as they each provide certain benefits for the other plants, e.g *pest repulsion* or *attract beneficial insects*.

The concept behind this project is that a ML model could be made which, based on various attributes of each plant, finds a corresponding companion plant.
